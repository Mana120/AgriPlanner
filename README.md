**AgriPlanner - Optimizing Crop Planning using Environmental Factors**

AgriPlanner is an innovative agricultural project designed to assist farmers in optimizing their crop planning based on key environmental factors. The project takes into account essential parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels in the soil, as well as external factors like Temperature (in degrees), Humidity (in %), pH level, and Rainfall (in mm). By leveraging this comprehensive dataset, AgriPlanner aims to provide tailored crop and fertilizer recommendations to farmers.

The project's user interface prompts the user to input the location details, starting with the choice of state, followed by the specific district within that state. By obtaining this geographical information, AgriPlanner can ensure that the recommendations are suited to the local conditions and climatic variations.

Upon entering the location details, AgriPlanner's algorithm processes the provided information along with the pre-existing soil nutrient levels. The project calculates a suitable crop and fertilizer combination for the given conditions. The primary focus of the recommendations is to maximize crop yield while minimizing resource waste and environmental impact.

As an example, if the user selects the state as Andhra Pradesh and specifies the district, AgriPlanner employs its advanced data analysis capabilities to generate a recommended crop type and the corresponding fertilizer blend. This recommendation is based on the specific nutrient levels, weather conditions, and other factors unique to the chosen location.

AgriPlanner serves as a powerful tool that empowers farmers to make informed decisions when planning their crops. By accounting for local variations in soil quality and climate, the project contributes to sustainable agricultural practices and improved productivity. It bridges the gap between traditional farming techniques and modern technology, resulting in optimized crop yields, reduced resource wastage, and increased economic efficiency for farmers in different regions.

The model is deployed using streamlit and this is how the frontend terminal looks like-
